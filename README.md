A bot that books goodlife gym sessions at a specific time using Puppeteer. 

### Motivation
Having to wake up or stay up until midnight to book a session can be an annoyance and mess up a good sleep schedule. 
Personally I like to go to the gym early in the morning so I made this bot to book the sessions for me.

### Notes
This is a node.js program that gets run once. Currently I use it with cron jobs to schedule the program to be run at midnight every night. 

### Features and Improvments
- [x] Books a session for my specific times on weekdays and weekends at a specific location.
- [ ] Allow user to select gym location
- [ ] Allow user to select different times for each day
- [ ] Move it into a webapp so others can ultize the tool
